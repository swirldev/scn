- Class: text
  Output: The assumption of non-autocorrelation is more frequently violated in case of relations estimated from time series data. For instance, in a study of the relationship between output and inputs of a firm or industry from monthly observations, non-autocorrelation of the disturbance implies that the effect of machine breakdown is strictly temporary in the sense that only the current month’s output is affected. But in practice, the effect of a machine breakdown in one month may affect current month’s output as well as the output of subsequent months.

  Output: Under the presence of autocorrelation and assume that the errors (disturbances) follow the  first-order autoregressive scheme(AR(1)).which one is false?
  AnswerChoices: cov(E_t,E_(t-2))=roha*Var(E_t);cov(E_t,E_(t-1)) is diffrent from zero;Var(E_t)=Var(u_t)/(1-coeffient of correlation(roha)),where u_t sattisfies all assumption of CLRM;cov(E_t,E_(t-2))=roha^2*Var(E_(t-2))
  CorrectAnswer: cov(E_t,E_(t-2))=roha*Var(E_t)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'cov(E_t,E_(t-2))=roha*Var(E_t)')

  Output: If the error terms are correlated(postively)and if we apply OLS, then which one is false about the properties of the estimators?
  AnswerChoices: The variances of regression coefficients will be  over-estimated;OLS estimator are unbiased;The variances of regression coefficients will be  under-estimated;High values of Coefficent of determination and inflated t-statistic;The estimated variances of the OLS estimators are biased,and as a consequence, the conventional confidence intervals and tests of significance are not valid
  CorrectAnswer: The variances of regression coefficients will be  over-estimated
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'The variances of regression coefficients will be  over-estimated')

  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='fit0<-lm(invest~vsh,data=auto)')
  Hint: hint

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Look the summary of 'fit0'. The F-statistic is significant at the 1% level. This indicates that the model is adequate.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(fit0)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(fit0)')
  Hint: hint

- Class: figure
  Output: Although the model passes the ANOVA test, we plot the estimated residuals against time and look for some model misspecifications. The graph (scatter plot) of the estimated disturbances (residuals) is shown here. We can see a clustering of neighbouring residuals on one or the other side of the line  e_hat=0. This might be a sign that the errors are autocorrelated. However, we do not make a final judgment until we apply formal tests of autocorrelation.

  Output:  One of the test for presence of autocorrelation in the error term is Breusch-Godfrey (BG) test. To apply BG test, first apply OLS and obtain the residuals, and then regress E_hat_t on X_t, E_hat_(t-1),...,E_hat_(t-p) and obtain the cooeffiecnt of detrmination(R_sq). Hence,Lets prepare our data for BG test and save the residuals of OLS in 'ei_hat' variable using  resid() command.
