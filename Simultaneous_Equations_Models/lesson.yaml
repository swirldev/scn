  Output: In the previous lessons, we were concerned exclusively with single-equation models, i.e., models in which there was a single dependent variable Y and one or more explanatory variables, the X’s. In such models the emphasis was on estimating and/or predicting the average value of Y conditional upon the fixed values of the X variables. The cause-and-effect relationship, if any, in such models therefore ran from the X’s to the Y(i.e., unidirectional). However, there are situations where there is a two-way flow of influence among economic variables. This occurs if Y is determined by the X’s, and some of the X’s are, in turn, determined by Y. In short, there is a two-way, or simultaneous, relationship between Y and (some of) the X’s, which makes the distinction between dependent and explanatory variables of dubious value.

  Output: In structural form of the model,some dpendent(endogenous) are included as regressor in the right hand side of SEM. The parameters are known as structural parameter and if applied an OLS, the result is biasd and inconsistent.
  

- Class: text
  Output: Reduced form of the SEM is an equation in which all the endogenous(dependent) variables are expressed as a function of predefined or predermined variables. The reduced parameters may be estimated by applying OLS and then the structural parameters.However, we should consider identfication problem.
  

- Class: text
  Output: Can we always recover the parameters of the structural equations uniquely from the 'π’s'? In other words, can we always estimate the structural coefficients via the reduced form coefficients?

- Class: text
  Output:  Identification is a problem of model formulation rather than of model estimation or appraisal.

- Class: text
  Output: We say a model is identified if it is in a unique statistical form, enabling unique estimators of its parameters to be subsequently made from sample data. 

- Class: text
  Output: In econometric theory, three possible situations of identifiability can arise':' equation under consideration is exactly identified, over identified or under identified.

- Class: text
  Output: If there is a one to one correspondence between the reduced form and structural form parameters, then we have  exact identification, that is, there is a unique solution for the structural parameters in terms of the reduced form parameters.

- Class: text
  Output: If the number of reduced form parameters exceeds the number of structural parameters, then we have over identification(no unique solution).

- Class: text
  Output: If the number of reduced form parameters is less than the number of structural parameters, then we have  under identification(no solution).

  CorrectAnswer: S (storage costs)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'S (storage costs)')
  Hint: hint

  Figure: r_sq.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which instrumental variable is better?
  AnswerChoices: Income(Y);Price of beer(PB);Adevertising (A)
  CorrectAnswer: Income(Y)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Income(Y)')
  Hint: hint

- Class: text
  Output: By comparing the estimated models using the three IV’s, it seems that income is the best IV as the resulting estimated model has the highest coefficient of determination (R_2=0.937). Since all variables are in logs, the coefficients are  elasticities. Thus, quantity supplied is responsive to both price and storage costs (both p-values < 0.001). In particular, the price elasticity of supply for wine is about 2.67.


- Class: text
  Output: Now, let's proceed to the second equation of the system, demand equation, using instrumental variable estimation. Lets remaind you the system equation as follow.

- Class: text
  Output: Supply equation [ Q_t=b0+b1PW_t+b2S_t+v_t ]

  Output: I am remainding you variable of the wine dataset.
  Figure: remaind_data.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The demand equation is exactly-identified. Thus, we will have only one instrumental variable for PB(price of wine) in this equation and is
  AnswerChoices: S (storage costs);Y (Income);PB (Price of wine);A (advertising expense)
  CorrectAnswer: S (storage costs)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'S (storage costs)')
  Hint: hint


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The first step is to regress price of wine (PW) on price of beer (PB), income (Y), advertising expense (A) and storage cost (S), and then get the predicted values of PW (Predicted price of wine). Now regress and save as 'prcwine_stor'.
  CorrectAnswer: prcwine_stor<-lm(price_wine~price_beer+income+advertising+storage_costs,data=win)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='prcwine_stor<-lm(price_wine~price_beer+income+advertising+storage_costs,data=win)')
  Hint: hint

  CorrectAnswer: predicted_PW<-fitted(prcwine_stor)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='predicted_PW<-fitted(prcwine_stor)')
  Hint: 
  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Then, the last step is to estimate the demand function by regressing consumption(Q) on Predicted price of wine (predicted_PW),price_beer, income and advertising. Let save as 'fit_dem'.
  CorrectAnswer: fit_dem<-lm(consumption~predicted_PW+price_beer+income+advertising,data=win)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='fit_dem<-lm(consumption~predicted_PW+price_beer+income+advertising,data=win)')
  Hint: please eneter the independent variable with the given order


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Run the summary of the model using summary command.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(fit_dem)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(fit_dem)')
  Hint: hint

- Class: text
  Output: We observe that the coefficient of determination is 95.5% and the F-statistic is significant. However, most of the regression coefficients are insignificant. Furthermore, all the coefficients except that of income (Y) have the wrong signs. This is probably due to multicollinearity and check it using vif function from car package.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Run 'vif(fit_dem)'
  CorrectAnswer: vif(fit_dem)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='vif(fit_dem)')
  Hint: hint

- Class: text
  Output: As can be seen from the above table, the variance inflation factor (VIF) for income and advertising expense are large (far greater than 10). Thus, we have to drop one of them.From practical point of view, it seems wise to drop advertising expense and re-estimate the model.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Regress by droping advertising expense by 'fit_dem_1<-lm(consumption~predicted_PW+price_beer+income,data=win)'
  CorrectAnswer: fit_dem_1<-lm(consumption~predicted_PW+price_beer+income,data=win)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='fit_dem_1<-lm(consumption~predicted_PW+price_beer+income,data=win)')
  Hint: hint

- Class: figure
  Output: The problem of MC is now solved as the VIF’s are greatly reduced (all less than 10).
  Figure: vif_dem.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: However, the coefficients of both price of wine and price of beer have wrong signs. In particular, the coefficient of price of wine not only has the wrong sign but is also significant. This is difficult to interpret. For the other variables, the conclusion we arrive at is that the demand for wine is not responsive to the price of beer, but is responsive to income. The income elasticity of demand for wine is about 2.3

- Class: text
  Output: We have seen the estimation using instrumental variables(IV) for the demand-supply equation of wine industry and now we will implement Estimation using two stages least squares (2SLS).
  

- Class: text
  Output: In two stages least squares method, we first find the reduced form equations by regressing each endogenous variable on all exogenous variables. Then we replace all the endogenous variables in each equation(in the structural EM) by their predicted values from the reduced forms and estimate each equation by OLS.


- Class: text
  Output: To estimate the supply equation,first we have to get a predicted value of  the endogenous variable price of wine(PW) found in the right hand side of this equation. Therfore, to get the predicted value of price of wine(PW), we have to regress price of wine (PW) on all exogenous variables of the whole system PB, Y, A and S. We then estimate the supply function by regressing consumption (Q) on predicted value of price of wine(PB) and storage costs(S).


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: So, regress the price_wine on price_beer, income,advertising, and storage_costs. save the result as 'pw2sls'.
  CorrectAnswer: pw2sls<-lm(price_wine~price_beer+income+advertising+storage_costs,data=win)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pw2sls<-lm(price_wine~price_beer+income+advertising+storage_costs,data=win)')
  Hint: hint

  Output: Determine the predicted value of price wine from the above and save as 'pw2sls_predicted'.
  CorrectAnswer: pw2sls_predicted<-fitted(pw2sls)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pw2sls_predicted<-fitted(pw2sls)')
  Hint: hint
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, estimate the supply function by regressing consumption (Q) on pw2sls_predicted(PW_t) and storage_costs(S_t). save result as 'fit2_sup'
  CorrectAnswer: fit2_sup<-lm(consumption~pw2sls_predicted+storage_costs,data=win)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='fit2_sup<-lm(consumption~pw2sls_predicted+storage_costs,data=win)')
  Hint: hint

- Class: figure
  Output: Estimation using 2SLS method provides only one estimate per parameter for over-identified models, and hence the result is
  Figure: two_sls.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: We can see from the above table that the coefficients of both price of wine and storage cost are significant. The price elasticity of supply is about 2.6. 

- Class: text
  Output: Now let proceed to estimate the demand equation':' So, regress the consumption on all exogenous variables of the equation, i.e.,price of wine(but use pw2sls_predicted )(PW), price of beer(PB), income(Y) and advertising(A).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: So, write to regress consumption on pw2sls_predicted, price_beer, income and advertising. save the result as 'fit2_dem'.
  CorrectAnswer: fit2_dem<-lm(consumption~pw2sls_predicted+price_beer+income+advertising,data=win)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='fit2_dem<-lm(consumption~pw2sls_predicted+price_beer+income+advertising,data=win)')
  Hint: hint
  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Run 'vif(fit2_dem)', and you will get a multicollinearity problem.
  CorrectAnswer: vif(fit2_dem)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='vif(fit2_dem)')
  Hint: hint

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: So, drop advertising and run 'fit2_dem_1<-lm(consumption~pw2sls_predicted+price_beer+income,data=win)'.
  CorrectAnswer: fit2_dem_1<-lm(consumption~pw2sls_predicted+price_beer+income,data=win)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='fit2_dem_1<-lm(consumption~pw2sls_predicted+price_beer+income,data=win)')
  Hint: hint

  Output: Run 'summary(fit2_dem_1)$coefficients'.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(fit2_dem_1)$coefficients
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(fit2_dem_1)$coefficients')
  Hint: hint
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Remember, you have saved the instrumental variable estimator of demand equation after droping advertising as 'fit_dem_1'. Now run 'summary(fit_dem_1)$coefficients'.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(fit_dem_1)$coefficients
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(fit_dem_1)$coefficients')
  Hint: hint
