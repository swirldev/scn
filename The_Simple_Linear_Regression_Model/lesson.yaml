- Class: text
  Output: This lesson is about  a two variable regression model(simple linear regression model) and uses to model the simplest economic relationship.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Regression analysis is concerned with describing and evaluating the relationship  between a given variable (often called the  dependent variable) and one or more variables which are assumed to influence the given variable (often called  independentor  explanatory variables).
           
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Suppose we are intersted to study the relationship between household income and expenditure on food. To study the r/ship, suppose you select a random sample of husehols from a particular population and you got a model':'Y=0.6X+120. Then ,sWhich is false?
  AnswerChoices: Income is estimated on the basis of expenditure;On the basis of income, we can predict expenditure;If the income of a 
                  certain household is 1500 Birr, then the estimated expenditure is 1020 Birr.;expenditure is estimated on the basis of income; expenditure is a dependent variable
  CorrectAnswer: Income is estimated on the basis of expenditure
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Income is estimated on the basis of expenditure')
  Hint: hint


- Class: text
  Output: Households with low income have a low expenditure and with high income high expenditure. This clearly shows expenditure depends on income.Y = 0.6X + 120, is a simple linear regression model beacuse we have only one independent variable(income). The coefficent of X(income) is postive and this supports the economic theory which states expenditure on economic goods dependes on income. Based on this model, the estimated expenditure for Household with income 1500 is about 1020.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: In reality,households with same income are not expected to spend equal on expenditure. This may be due to':'
  AnswerChoices: None;some may contain teenagers but some may contain senior citizens;Diffrence in family size;diffrence in preference;diffrent geographic location causes to vary the demand and so as to vary they spend on expenditure;diffrence in preference between households towards substitute goods
  CorrectAnswer: None
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'None')
  Hint: hint

- Class: mult_question
  Output: In reality,individual household with same income are not expected to spend equal expenditure on food.As a result the simple linear regression model is express as $Y=\alpha+\betaX+error trem(E)$. Which one is not reason for includeing the error term?
  AnswerChoices: Simple model is not good and hence to compnset it;To include omitted relevant variables which are not included in the model; Some households may not tell us or forget thier accurate data about thier income and hence due to a measurment error;Due to sampling error;Due to wrong functional form
  CorrectAnswer: Simple model is not good and hence to compnset it
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Simple model is not good and hence to compnset it')

- Class: text
  Output: If a regression equation does a good job of describing the relationship between two variables, the explained sum of squares should constitute a large proportion of the total sum of squares. Thus, it would be of interest to determine the magnitude of this proportion by computing the ratio of the explained sum of squares to the total sum of squares. This proportion is called the sample coefficient of determination,R_squared.

- Class: cmd_question

  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='R_sq')
  Hint: remeber the variable you saved for coefficient of determination

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which one is false about the coefficient of determination?
  AnswerChoices: A small value of R_sq shows that the regression equation is statistically insignificant.;A low value of R_sq indicates that even though you include a relevant variable X but its influence on Y is weak as compared to some other variables that are omitted from the regression equation;About 50% of the variation in electricity consumption is due to changes in the price of electricity.;A low value of R_sq indicates that the regression equation is misspecified;The remaining 50% of the variation in electricity consumption is not due to changes in the price of electricity, but instead due to chance and other factors not included in the model.; A low value of R_sq indicates that X is a poor explanatory variable in the sense that variation in X leaves Y unaffected.
  CorrectAnswer: A small value of R_sq shows that the regression equation is statistically insignificant.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'A small value of R_sq shows that the regression equation is statistically insignificant.')
  Hint: hint

- Class: text
  Output: How much is small or large for R squared value? This subjective and it varies from discipline to discipline. To conclude we have to made an objective statistical test known by F-test. The F test is designed to test the significance of all variables or a set of variables in a regression model. In the two-variable model, however, it is used to test the explanatory power of a single variable (X), and at the same time, is equivalent to the test of significance of R Square.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To calculate the F statistic, please we use 'F_stat<-(RSS/(2-1))/(ESS/(nrow(elcty)-2))'
  CorrectAnswer: F_stat<-(RSS/(2-1))/(ESS/(nrow(elcty)-2))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='F_stat<-(RSS/(2-1))/(ESS/(nrow(elcty)-2))')
  Hint: hint

- Class: figure
  Output: the tabulated F-statistic for alpha=0.05 is given by the command (F_tab<-qf(p=0.05,df1=1,df2=14,lower.tail = F))
  Figure: F_tab.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: Since the calculated variance ratio exceeds the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis of no linear relationship between price and consumption of electricity at the 5% level of significance. Thus, we then conclude that R Squared is significant, that is, the linear regression model is adequate and is useful for prediction purposes.
